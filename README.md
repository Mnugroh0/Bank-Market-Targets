# Bank-Market-Targets

This project was inspired by a bank's desire to find an efficient approach to persuade clients to make deposits because deposits are their main source of income. Telephone outreach has been proven to be the most successful of the several outreach techniques utilized, but it is also very expensive. In order to lower the cost of telephone campaigns and increase the number of depositing clients, this project tries to identify customers who are more likely to take a deposit. 

**Workflow used in this project:**
1. Taking a quick look at the data.
2. Performing exploratory data analysis. 
3. Prepare the data for Machine Learning Models. 
4. Splitting data. 
5. Creating a benchmark model. 
6. Feature engineering.
7. Handling imbalanced datasets.  
8. Tuning the model. 
9. Features Importances. 
10. Features Selection. 
11. Evaluate Model.

Even if the precision and recall ratings for this project may not have been very high, they might still be higher. However, the total ROC-AUC score of 92% shows that the model is performing well in separating positive and negative cases.
